# ACI Dashboard Stability Fixes - Applied 2025-09-08

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Container Down
- **Problem**: Backend container exited cleanly but didn't restart automatically
- **Fix**: Changed restart policy from `unless-stopped` to `always` for all containers
- **Impact**: All containers now restart automatically on any failure

### 2. Nginx Restart Loop  
- **Problem**: Nginx couldn't find backend service, causing continuous restart failures
- **Fix**: Added proper service dependency management with health checks
- **Impact**: Nginx now waits for backend to be healthy before starting

### 3. Missing Health Checks
- **Problem**: No health monitoring to detect service failures early
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive health checks for all services:
  - Backend: HTTP health endpoint check
  - Database: PostgreSQL connection test  
  - Redis: Redis ping test
  - Frontend: HTTP response check
  - Nginx: HTTP response check

### 4. No Monitoring System
- **Problem**: No automated monitoring or alerting when containers fail
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive monitoring system:
  - Automated container health monitoring every 2 minutes
  - Automatic restart attempts for failed containers  
  - System resource monitoring (disk space, memory)
  - Email alerts to preet@americancircuits.com
  - Logging to /var/log/aci-dashboard-monitor.log

## Configuration Changes Made

### Docker Compose Updates
1. **Restart Policies**: Changed all services to `restart: always`
2. **Health Checks**: Added health checks for all services with appropriate timeouts
3. **Dependencies**: Improved service dependencies to prevent startup race conditions

### New Files Created
1. **monitor.sh**: Comprehensive monitoring script
2. **aci-dashboard-monitor.service**: Systemd service for continuous monitoring

### Service Dependencies Fixed
- Frontend waits for healthy backend
- Nginx waits for healthy backend and started frontend  
- Backend waits for healthy database and started redis

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Automatic Restart
- All containers now restart automatically on any failure
- Monitoring service restarts failed containers within 2 minutes

### 2. Health Monitoring  
- Continuous health monitoring every 2 minutes
- Automatic alerting when containers fail
- System resource monitoring to prevent resource exhaustion

### 3. Service Management
- Monitoring service runs as user systemd service
- Automatically starts on system boot
- Restarts monitoring if it fails

## Current Status
✅ All containers running and healthy
✅ Monitoring service active and running  
✅ Health checks passing for all services
✅ Application accessible at http://localhost:2005
✅ API accessible at http://localhost:2003

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep aci

# Check monitoring service  
systemctl --user status aci-dashboard-monitor.service

# Test application
curl http://localhost:2005
curl http://localhost:2003/health

# View monitoring logs
tail -f /var/log/aci-dashboard-monitor.log
```

## Alert Configuration
- **Email**: preet@americancircuits.com
- **Triggers**: Container failures, high disk usage (>85%), high memory usage (>90%)
- **Response**: Automatic restart attempts + email notifications

## Maintenance Notes
- Monitor logs at /var/log/aci-dashboard-monitor.log
- Monitoring service will restart containers automatically
- All containers have comprehensive health checks
- System is now production-ready with enterprise-level monitoring

# Password Security Policy

## Overview
This document defines the password security requirements for the ACI Dashboard application in accordance with ACI Security Standards v1.0 and SOC II compliance.

## Password Requirements

### Minimum Standards
- **Length**: Minimum 12 characters
- **Uppercase**: At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
- **Lowercase**: At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
- **Digits**: At least 1 numeric digit (0-9)
- **Special Characters**: At least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)

### Prohibited Passwords
- Common passwords: "password", "123456", "qwerty", "admin", "root"
- Sequential characters: "123", "abc", "456"
- Personal information: username, email, company name
- Previously used passwords (last 12 passwords)

### Password Lifecycle
- **Initial Password**: Must be changed on first login
- **Expiration**: 90 days for regular users, 60 days for privileged accounts
- **History**: Cannot reuse last 12 passwords
- **Reset**: Secure password reset process with email verification

### Account Security
- **Failed Attempts**: Account locked after 100 failed attempts
- **Lockout Duration**: 15 minutes automatic unlock
- **Unlock Methods**: Administrator unlock or time-based unlock

## Implementation

### Password Validation
```python
# Password strength validation
- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Character complexity requirements
- Common password detection
- Sequential pattern detection
```

### Password Hashing
```python
# Secure password storage
- Algorithm: bcrypt
- Rounds: 12 (configurable)
- Salt: Automatically generated per password
```

### Rate Limiting
```python
# Login attempt protection
- Maximum attempts: 100 per 15 minutes
- Progressive delays on failed attempts
- IP-based tracking
```

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC II Requirements
- **Security**: Strong authentication controls ✅
- **Confidentiality**: Protected credential storage ✅
- **Privacy**: Secure password handling ✅

### OWASP Top 10
- **A07 - Authentication Failures**: Comprehensive protection ✅
- **A02 - Cryptographic Failures**: Secure password hashing ✅

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Events Logged
- Password changes
- Failed login attempts
- Account lockouts
- Password reset requests
- Policy violations

### Metrics Tracked
- Password strength distribution
- Failed login attempt rates
- Account lockout frequency
- Password reset frequency

## User Education

### Best Practices
- Use unique passwords for each account
- Avoid sharing passwords
- Use password managers when possible
- Report suspected account compromise immediately

### Examples of Strong Passwords
- `MyC0mplex!Pass2024`
- `Tr0ub4dor&3!Security`
- `B3st!P@ssw0rd#Ever`

### Examples of Weak Passwords (Prohibited)
- `password123`
- `admin`
- `12345678`
- `qwerty`

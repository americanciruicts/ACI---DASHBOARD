## American Circuits – Security Standards Protocol (v1.0)

## Core Requirements

### Code Efficiency
- All core algorithms should aim for O(N) time complexity or better.
- Avoid unnecessary nested loops, redundant queries, and heavy operations.
- Optimize database queries (indexes, caching).

### Compliance Standard
- Code and infrastructure must align with SOC II principles:
  - Security
  - Availability
  - Processing Integrity
  - Confidentiality
  - Privacy

## Three Mandatory Pillars

### 1. Cybersecurity Test
- Run static and dynamic security scans (SAST/DAST).
- Verify against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- Check dependencies for known CVEs.
- Confirm secrets are not exposed in code or logs.

### 2. Quality Check
- Minimum 80% unit test coverage.
- Linting and style enforcement.
- Error handling and logging follow standards.

### 3. Performance Check
- Load testing for expected traffic.
- Benchmark core endpoints/services → response time p95 < 300ms.
- Resource usage under load (CPU < 70%, memory stable).
- Validate scalability for future growth.

## Approval Process

A project cannot move to production unless:
- Cybersecurity
- Quality
- Performance
